# Public COVID-19 Data for Norway (covid19data.no)

Heads-up: This repo is a work in progress. Links may break and the repo may be set to private for singificant updates in the coming days. See [covid19data.no](https://www.covid19data.no/) for a more user-friendly intro.

### Motivation
The current state of publicly available data about the COVID-19-situtation in Norway is a mix of [PDF-reports](https://www.fhi.no/sv/smittsomme-sykdommer/corona/dags--og-ukerapporter/dags--og-ukerapporter-om-koronavirus/), [Excel-files](https://www.nav.no/no/nav-og-samfunn/statistikk/arbeidssokere-og-stillinger-statistikk/permitterte), [Power BI-dashboards](https://www.helsedirektoratet.no/statistikk/antall-innlagte-pasienter-pa-sykehus-med-pavist-covid-19) and public registries. Further, much of the data is only released as cumulative statistics at aggregated levels (e.g. [MSIS](http://www.msis.no/)). This has created a market for media outlets to release local "situation reports" behind paywalls (see: [Aftenposten](https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/K3mnr4/i-det-meste-av-landet-bremser-viruset-opp-i-oslo-sprer-det-seg-raskt-fra-bydel-til-bydel)). The motivation for this project is to collect disparate data sources of Covid-19 in Norway and make them freely available to the public in a timely and coherent manner.
