# Public COVID-19 Data for Norway (covid19data.no)

### Motivation
The current state of publicly available data about the COVID-19-situtation in Norway is a mix of [PDF-reports](https://www.fhi.no/sv/smittsomme-sykdommer/corona/dags--og-ukerapporter/dags--og-ukerapporter-om-koronavirus/), [Excel-files](https://www.nav.no/no/nav-og-samfunn/statistikk/arbeidssokere-og-stillinger-statistikk/permitterte), [Power BI-dashboards](https://www.helsedirektoratet.no/statistikk/antall-innlagte-pasienter-pa-sykehus-med-pavist-covid-19) and public registries. Further, much of the data is only released as cumulative statistics at aggregated levels (e.g. [MSIS](http://www.msis.no/)). This has created a market for media outlets to release local "situation reports" behind paywalls (see: [Aftenposten](https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/K3mnr4/i-det-meste-av-landet-bremser-viruset-opp-i-oslo-sprer-det-seg-raskt-fra-bydel-til-bydel)). The motivation for this project is to collect disparate data sources of Covid-19 in Norway and make them freely available to the public in a timely and coherent manner.

### Contributing to the project
This project is a collaborative and voluntary effort and we would love your help.

### Use of data

[![Case Dashboard](docs/img/MSIS_dashboard_full.PNG)](https://www.covid19data.no/examples/01_case_dashboard/)
The [Norway Case Dashboard](https://www.covid19data.no/examples/01_case_dashboard/) illustrates how some of this data can be used. The dashboard shows current Covid-19 Cases in Norway at municipality and district-level based reported to the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS) with fully available source code. Going forward, more dashboards and visualizations will be posted in the examples-section.
